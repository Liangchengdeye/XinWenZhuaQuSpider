 as \u201ca party with a clear political philosophy, consistent with governance... It would attract members by the strength of that philosophy, rather than by modifying it to pander to special interest groups. Its members in office would focus on doing the people's work, including making compromises with members of other parties when necessary so that the perfect does not become the enemy of the good. It would stand for maximum personal liberty and economic reality. It would at all times strive to ensure that government is never any larger than it needs to be.\u201d\u00a0The above good qualities are visible on the day to day activities of the world\u2019s largest political party, the Communist Party of China (CPC).No doubt that CPC continues to enjoy a fruitful relationship with its political allies across the globe. It has successfully established a stronger political relationship with more than 400 political parties in more than 160 countries. This is done under four key principles: the CPC maintains its independence; ensures complete equality \u2013 which deals with treating all its relations equally; have mutual respect \u2013 respecting the opinions of the different political parties; non-interference in the internal arrangements of political parties; and does not impose its ideology on them.The ruling All People\u2019s Congress Party of Sierra Leone (APC) happens to be one of the good allies of the CPC. The history between the two development-oriented political parties could be traced as far back as 1979 after the two nations established diplomatic relations on the foundation of mutual trust and respect in July 1971. Sierra Leone voted in favor of a United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758, recognizing the People\u2019s Republic of China as the only and legitimate representative of China in the UN Body, just three months after entering into diplomatic ties.That produced dividend in terms of much-needed infrastructure in Sierra Leone from China, in the areas of Magbass Sugar Complex - under agriculture; Youyi Building, Military and Police Headquarters, Mange and Kambia Bridges \u2013 under infrastructure etc.The China-Sierra Leone friendship, which was started by then-President Siaka Stevens of Sierra Leone and Chairman Mao of China, has not only further strengthen the diplomatic and people-to-people relationship between China and Sierra Leone, but has lifted the bars of political diplomacy, and expanded the cultural relationship between the two countries.The month of October serves as a busy moment for both political parties, whose membership will be meeting to not only discuss successes and the way forward but also to inaugurate a new line-up of leaders who will rule their parties for the next five years.The APC agreed to hold its national delegates\u2019 conference on the 14th and 15th October, 2017 at the newly constructed Ernest Bai Koroma conference Center in Makeni City, whilst the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China will be held in Beijing, the People's Republic of China, opening on the 18th October, 2017.Coincidentally both leaders, President Xi Jinping of China and Dr. Ernest Bai Koroma of Sierra Leone, \u00a0celebrated their 64th birthdays this year. But on the other side of the presidential equation, whilst President Koroma is saying goodbye to the presidency after completing his second term in office, his counterpart, President Xi Jinping, who is also the party general secretary and the head of China's military, is all but assured of a second five-year term.As a leader that will continue to hold on to the mantle of leadership in his party, President Koroma has enjoyed working with China and appreciates the continued support and intervention in many areas of economic, education, and technical cooperation. He has on several occasions reaffirmed Sierra Leone\u2019s commitment and support to the one-china policy, assuring further deepening and strengthening the already existing cordial bilateral ties between the two countries and peoples for mutual benefit.On the China\u2019s side, President Xi has a stronger conviction that both Sierra Leone and the People\u2019s Republic of China share common friendly relations and has assured that the bilateral relations between the two countries will grow from strength to strength.Such friendly relations between the two countries have further strengthened not just the bilateral relations between China and Sierra Leone but helped to promote the Sino-Africa relations.China continues to support development programmes in Sierra Leone, agreed upon for the mutual benefit of all sides and also implement exchanges, especially at the political level.The relationship between the two countries was however not much effective under other regimes since the APC under late President Dr. Joseph Saidu Momoh was overthrown by the military in 1992. The return of the APC to office in 2007 under the leadership of President Dr. Ernest Bai Koroma, saw a swift rebirth of the excellent relationship between China and Sierra Leone.Each year, the CPC receives over twenty delegations from different political parties in Africa to exchange ideas in conferences and meetings where development issues are mostly discussed. CPC Central Committee members, on the other hand, are sent annually to visit some Africa countries as part of the multilateral exchange visits.Since 2007, both parties have continued to have high-level exchange visits, leading to the APC learning much about China\u2019s development stirred by the CPC. Key areas of development like intercity, towns, district and provincial connections with good roads, maintenance of peace, agricultural development, national economic growth, and etc., are amongst key development spheres Sierra Leone has learned from China.Another area learned by the APC is the principal role of the CPC, which affords the party the opportunity to be the guiding instrument for policy and programmes. The CPC does not only provide guidelines but is participants at every level in the development of China. For the APC, it has provided the guideline in the \u2018Agenda for Change\u2019 and \u2018Agenda for Prosperity\u2019 which concentrated on major sectors of the Sierra Leone economy.President Koroma will be happily leaving a sound legacy with the help of China. His visit to China in 2016 saw the singing of six cooperation agreements, including 300 million RMB Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement; Freetown Ring Road (Limkokwing University to Regent Village); Debt Relief of 20 million RMB (of previous Interest-Free Loan); Establishment of Consultation Mechanism between the two foreign ministries; Cooperation Agreement for Hospital Partner Assistance; and Mutual Visa Exemption of Diplomatic and Service (Official) Passport Holders.There is progress in the energy sector with an improvement from 6 megawatts inherited to now over 100 megawatts. With the help of China, the country is having hydro projects and has gotten assurances for other areas such telecommunications, transport, and communication. There is also an increase in the number of scholarships offered by China to deserving Sierra Leonean students. This year, 113 students have been offered the opportunity to study in various fields and institutions in the People\u2019s Republic of China.Both countries continue to pursue mutually beneficial cooperation. China under Preside Xi has made a commitment towards the construction of a Centre for Disease Control (CDC) in Sierra Leone to serve the West African Sub Region and building the capacity of Sierra Leone\u2019s health sector.Sierra Leone, under President Koroma, is using the scaled-up bilateral relations through comprehensive, strategic cooperative partnership in a bid to fully take advantage of the ten point cooperation package announced during the 2015 Johannesburg Forum on China\u2013Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) Summit, which focuses on industrialization, agricultural modernization, infrastructure, financial services, green development, trade and investment facilitation, poverty reduction and public welfare, public health, people-to-people exchanges, and peace and security.I believe that there is some truth in the adage, \"Great leaders are born, not made.\" To some extent, the capacity for great leadership is innate. President Xi has clearly demonstrated to the world that learning how to be a more effective leader is within everyone\u2019s grasp \u2013 whether you lead a nation, multiple teams, an entire company or just one staff member.Both Xi of CPC and Koroma of APC are political leaders with a combination of charisma and integrity, as well as having the ability to assess a situation and make a decision based on what would be best for the greatest number of people. Most of all, they have proven that leadership in a political framework that requires \u2018statesmanship\u2019 \u2013 as opposed to just being a \u2018politician\u2019 \u2013 this means having the integrity and willingness to stand up for what is right.The \u2018OCTOBER\u2019 Family Meetings of CPC (China) and APC (Sierra Leone) is a sharing of good purpose of political leadership. Whilst President Koroma will be saying goodbye to the seat of power; President Xi will be receiving greater assurances of support from his comrades in the CPC and will have his presidential mandate extended.\u00a0", "NEW_TIME": "2017-10-09", "NEW_TITLE": "Op-ed: The 'October' Family Meetings of CPC and APC: Sharing a Good Purpose of Political Leadership", "NEW_IMG": " | http://en.people.cn/NMediaFile/2017/1009/FOREIGN201710091408000595347793235.jpg", "NEW_ID": "20171009900009277487", "NEW_IMG_TITLE": ""}
{"NEW_BODY": "King Salman of Saudi Arabia recently announced that the kingdom finally agreed to let women drive, starting next year. Related departments have 30 days to give comments. The statement means that the only country that had banned women from driving will see women sitting behind wheel starting June, 2018, which is a big leap to the goal of equal rights.Saudi Arabia is seeing positive changes pushed by the rapid development of this era. In 2011, women were granted the right to vote and be voted in local elections. In 2014, 30 women were elected to the Consultative Assembly. Women were invited to attend the National Day celebration for the first time last week. The royal family has been devoted to contributing to the equality of men and women in the country. \u201cThe decision was not just a major social change but part of the country\u2019s economic reforms,\u201d said Prince Khaled bin Salman, Saudi Arabia\u2019s ambassador to the United States.The most essential element behind the goal of equality of men and women is the reformation of concept. After the ban was removed, some women immediately got on the road for test driving. Some driving schools said they received many phone calls from women. In contrast, some conservative men still think that driving is a crime for women and urged people with \u201cmorality\u201d to protest against the change.

Sorry, but only one thing will work!\" Trump tweeted.The vague threat comes on the heels of other recent suggestions that Trump is eager to resolve the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue with hard power. In his first major speech to the UN, Trump threatened to \"totally destroy\" the DPRK if necessary; and just days later, he took to Twitter to warn that Kim Jong Un's days are numbered, saying that if the Foreign Minister of the DPRK echoes his leader's thoughts, \"they won\u2019t be around much longer.\"Trump has repeatedly made clear his distaste for dialogue with and preference for military action against the DPRK. \"Being nice to Rocket Man hasn\u2019t worked in 25 years, why would it work now?\" Trump tweeted, adding: \"I won\u2019t fail.\" In a different tweet, Trump told US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson that he is \"wasting his time\" trying to open the door of negotiating with the DPRK, and that he is prepared to \"do what has to be done.\"But war on the Korean Peninsula would be catastrophic, and dialogue remains the best option.To be fair, there is logic behind Trump\u2019s threats against the DPRK. His threats seem to be part of a larger strategy, coherent or not, to instill fear in Pyongyang, so that it will agree to US demands to abandon all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs. But Trump\u2019s strategy could backfire bigly. Throwing the steering wheel out the window heightens, rather than reduces, the fear that war on the Korean Peninsula is imminent, undermining efforts to bring both sides back to talks.In response to the latest report, China continued to stress dialogue and negotiation as the most effective way to break out of the security dilemma, and has urged the two sides to stop with the games and cool it with the threats. \"The current situation on the Korean Peninsula remains highly complex and severe. We hope that various parties can strictly observe and implement the UN Security Council resolutions, refrain from provoking each other and aggravating the contradiction, [and] exercise restraint and caution to ease the tension,\" Hua Chunying, spokeswoman of China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Monday.China also reiterated that the core of the issue is the security issue between the two sides. \"Only by addressing the legitimate security concern of various parties in a balanced manner can we truly open the door to peacefully resolving the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue. To this end, various parties need to show more sincerity, sit down at the negotiating table, enhance mutual trust through dialogue, and seek a viable way out for peaceful settlement of the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue through negotiation,\" Hua Chunying added.", "NEW_TIME": "2017-10-10", "NEW_TITLE": "As Korean Peninsula tension heats up, China tells US, DPRK to cool it", "NEW_IMG": " | http://en.people.cn/NMediaFile/2017/1010/FOREIGN201710101337000107544623981.jpg | http://en.people.cn/NMediaFile/2017/1010/FOREIGN201710101335000405030608342.jpg", "NEW_ID": "20171010900009277923", "NEW_IMG_TITLE": "Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hua Chunying"}

Sky Hunter featured a Chinese air force hostage rescue mission, while Operation Red Sea set its background in Chinese navy\u2019s evacuation mission during the Yemen Crisis.In the movie Sky Hunter, several fighter jets like the J-10 and J-20 made their debut, and even the latest Y-20 air freighter was included in the movie.The rise in frequency of advanced Chinese military weapons shows that the military attaches more and more significance on its image-building in movies, commented PLA Daily on its WeChat account.The commentary noted that it is a common practice among the world\u2019s military to promote its image and the US military has been shown in numerous Hollywood products as a power of justice against evil.Meanwhile, the Chinese military takes pride in protecting its citizens at home and abroad with increasingly advanced weapons, which is not only a factual report of the military\u2019s development, but should become a signature on the screen, PLA Daily said.", "NEW_TIME": "2017-10-12", "NEW_TITLE": "Chinese military makes more public display on big screen", "NEW_IMG": " | http://en.people.cn/NMediaFile/2017/1012/FOREIGN201710121707000057134393192.jpg | http://en.people.cn/NMediaFile/2017/1012/FOREIGN201710121707000366886380494.jpg", "NEW_ID": "20171012900009279246", "NEW_IMG_TITLE": ""}
{"NEW_BODY": "With the ascendency of China recognized by all, though worrying to some, foreign analysts and media look to the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China for clues about China\u2019s future. It is no secret that President Xi Jinping, during his almost five years as China\u2019s senior-most leader, has strengthened the Party\u2019s role in governing China \u2014 and foreigners have questions. I\u2019m asked these questions by foreign media and I think it is useful to state and examine them.What is it about the Party, the CPC, and its governing philosophy, that makes Xi so committed to enhancing the Party\u2019s governing power? What are the Party\u2019s positions and policies, organization and governance, vision and challenges? Why has China opted for perpetual CPC leadership? Would China be more stable with a competitive multi-party system? How does the CPC as the ruling party claim legitimacy? What innovations has Xi brought to the Party\u2019s leadership role in the economy and society? Why has Xi elevated \u201cstrict discipline of the Party\u201d to the highest level of national importance, the fourth of his \u201cFour Comprehensives\u201d for governing China? Why is his anti-corruption campaign so relentless?Answers to these questions lead to a more basic question: How has the Party led China to its remarkable development and modernization? How has the Party adapted to changing conditions, kept up with the times? What can we learn from the Party\u2019s history, its triumphs and tragedies? What is it about the Party\u2019s recent past that it must now be rejuvenated?But can a system with a perpetually ruling party discipline itself, itself establish credible checks-and-balances? Is transparency the Party\u2019s foe or friend? What challenges does the Party face? What does the Party consider its greatest dangers? And what are its enduring ideals, its visions for the future? Under Xi\u2019s core leadership, how might the Party\u2019s role in governing China develop over the next five or ten years?China requires strong leadership to maintain stability given China\u2019s unique, complex challenges: domestically (slower growth, industrial overcapacity, endemic pollution, imbalanced development, income disparity, social injustice, social service demands) and internationally (regional conflicts, sluggish economies, volatile markets, trade protectionism, ethnic clashes, terrorism, geopolitical rivalries, territorial disputes).The augmented role of the Party in governing commercial corporations \u2014 private and even foreign companies, not only state-owned enterprises \u2014 exemplifies Xi\u2019s determination to strengthen the Party\u2019s leadership of the country. Xi\u2019s unprecedented anti-corruption campaign has won strong public support. His determination to root-out corruption and cut the wasteful and detested perks of officialdom is altering how officials in government, and executives in state-owned enterprises, work and even think.But some foreign analysts see Xi\u2019s anti-corruption campaign as a weapon of political power, thus reflecting their superficial and one-dimensional understanding of China. Befitting the size and complexity of the country, for almost every decision of importance, China\u2019s leaders have multiple motivations or reasons.For the anti-corruption campaign, I can see ten motivations or reasons.First, to state the obvious, officials who are manifestly corrupt are brought to justice. To manage China\u2019s huge society, there must be respect for law and judicial impartiality.Second, by combatting corruption the Party increases public trust, building confidence in the Party\u2019s leadership.Third, by combatting corruption the Party functions more effectively and efficiently, making decisions for the general good, not biased by personal benefits.Fourth, corruption distorts markets, so that by reducing corruption, resources are allocated more efficiently.Fifth, corrupt officials impede economic reform because change threatens their private interests. The removal of corrupt officials facilitates reform.Sixth, corrupt officials thwart rule of law for personal interests and prosecuting them strengthens rule of law for the national interest. Rule of law is exceedingly important, the third of Xi\u2019s \u201cFour Comprehensives.\u201dSeventh, some corrupt officials, in addition to enriching themselves, have non-standard political ambitions that could destabilize the system; their removal helps maintain national unity and political stability, which is essential for China.Eighth, for China to become a world business center, China must have world-class business ethics and standards.Ninth, combatting corruption benefits China\u2019s entire society, elevating morality and restoring Chinese civilization as a paragon of ethics and integrity.Tenth, for China to become a global role model, China must exemplify morality and rectitude.The CPC is a work in process. For the world to understand China, it must understand why the Party asserts that its continuing political leadership is optimum for China\u2019s development. One key is the Party\u2019s adaptability, stressing experimentation and testing of new policies.All systems of governance have trade-offs. The benefits of a system with a single leading party include implementing critical policies rapidly and assuring that strategies which require long-term commitment, have long-term commitment - for example, China's Belt and Road Initiative. The costs or dangers of a system with a single leading party is that society is much more dependent on the quality of its leaders, and much more vulnerable to their vicissitudes and excesses. There are trade-offs too in stricter public regulations, including media.The Party\u2019s leadership is deemed essential for China to continue its current development. Yet to continue to earn its leadership, the Party has a higher obligation to enhance rectitude of governance, standards of living and personal well-being \u2014 which includes rule of law, transparency in government, public oversight, institutionalized checks and balances, increasing democracy, various freedoms, and human rights.Going forward in the \"new era\", the Party faces challenges - furthering economic reform and transformation, and guiding social development and transition - while at the same time, improving transparency and building institutions that are self-regulating. The Party claims a historic mission. The Party will continue to be judged by the results.Robert Lawrence Kuhn is a public intellectual, political/economics commentator, and international corporate strategist.

{"NEW_BODY": "Notable for the large amount of silt it carries, the Yellow River, China\u2019s second longest river, has become a limpid waterway in recent years, thanks to the country\u2019s progress in hydraulic engineering and ecological construction.Considered both as the cradle of Chinese civilization and the country\u2019s ecological malady, the Yellow River is vital for China\u2019s agriculture, yet the large amount of sediment it carries can clog reservoirs, break levees, and even cause potentially catastrophic floods. According to statistics, if it runs to the sea with sufficient volume, more than 1.1 billion tons of silt can be carried to the sea annually.Though being rampant with silt for thousands of year, the river has been tamed in the past two decades, thanks to China\u2019s water conservancy projects, including the Xiaolangdi Dam, which have been purging the silt-clogged river since 2002.\u201cThe river has been clean for over ten years, sometimes the color of the river even turns into crystal green. Once a river with great power that can churn up waves as high as 2 meters, it now appears to be quiet and peaceful,\u201d Jia Changzhi, a peasant from Yonghe, Shanxi province, who has been living along the river for his whole life, told the China Youth Daily.According to experts, ever since the Xiaolangdi Dam started impounding water from the Yellow River in 1999, the slit in the river has reduced significantly. The downstream of the river carried only 64 million tons of silt annually from 2000 to 2015, reducing 1.1 billion from the average since 1950 to 1999.\u201cThe Yellow River has become clean 43 times in history, with the longest clean period of over 20 days in 1727. Since 2000, the river has been clean for even longer periods,\u201d Li Erong, a geological history expert, told the China Youth Daily.Desludging the Yellow River has always been a dream for many Chinese scientists and the public. Zhu Xianmo, a renowned scientist from the Chinese Academy of Science who died on Oct. 11, has devoted all his life to the cause, pointing out that the permeability of the soil is the key to purge the river.\u201cIf the management of the Yellow River runs smoothly, even elderly people like me may witness emerald water running in the Yellow River,\u201d said Zhu at the age of 88, a dream that has become true as 80 percent of the river remains clean during the non-flood season now.", "NEW_TIME": "2017-10-12", "NEW_TITLE": "China cleans silt-clogged Yellow River", "NEW_IMG": " | http://en.people.cn/NMediaFile/2017/1012/FOREIGN201710121730000157411638440.jpg | http://en.people.cn/NMediaFile/2017/1012/FOREIGN201710121732000464441798121.jpg | http://en.people.cn/NMediaFile/2017/1012/FOREIGN201710121732000597060884598.jpg", "NEW_ID": "20171012900009279265", "NEW_IMG_TITLE": ""}
